# Text File Manager
## Introduction
This project started as a way for me to clear the clutter of .txt files I have plastered around my desktop and in random locations on my computer. It was quickly turned into a random assortment of features that work for all file types, in theory that is. I appreciate any and all help from anyone, simply create a .md file to show me that you are working on this, and list your name and the feature that you have implemented in detail.
